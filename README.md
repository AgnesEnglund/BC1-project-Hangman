# BC1-project-Hangman
# Description
First project committed to GitHub.
A Hangman game where the user is guessing letters in a secret, randomly chosen word. To win the game the user must find all the correct letters in the secret word before he/she runs out of attempts.
The purpose of the project was to gain experience in the process of planning, developing and commiting a code project.
# Project status
First beta-version. Functional game but needs updates:
# Possible future updates
Allow for the user to choose to play another round before exiting the system
Allow for the user to input his/her own secret word
Randomize the secret word from a file containing a big number of words
Allow for the user to choose game difficulty based on number of attempts
Allow for the user to choose game difficulty based on a categorization of secret-word difficulty
ALlow for the user to trade attempts for hints
